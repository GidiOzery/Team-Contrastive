# Dataset preparation

If you want to reproduce the results in the paper for benchmark evaluation or training, you will need to setup datasets.

### ParallelDomain (PD)

This is the synthetic dataset provided by [Parallel Domain](https://paralleldomain.com), which is used to pre-train our model. You can download the images together with annotations under this [link](https://tri-ml-public.s3.amazonaws.com/datasets/pd_release.tar.gz). After downloading, copy the contents into `$PermaTrack_ROOT/data/pd`.

### KITTI Tracking

We use KITTI Tracking to train and evaluate the system in the real world. Following prior work, we will only use the training set (and create a validation set from it) for developing this project.

- Download [images](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_tracking_image_2.zip), and [annotations](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_tracking_label_2.zip) from [KITTI Tracking website](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_tracking.php) and unzip. Place or symlink the data as below:

  ~~~
  ${PermaTrack_ROOT}
  |-- data
  `-- |-- kitti_tracking
      `-- |-- data_tracking_image_2
          |   |-- training
          |   |-- |-- image_02
          |   |-- |-- |-- 0000
          |   |-- |-- |-- ...
          |-- |-- testing
          |-- label_02
          |   |-- 0000.txt
          |   |-- ...
  ~~~

- Run `python convert_kittitrack_to_coco.py` in `tools` to convert the annotation into COCO format. 
- The resulting data structure should look like:

  ~~~
  ${PermaTrack_ROOT}
  |-- data
  `-- |-- kitti_tracking
      `-- |-- data_tracking_image_2
          |   |-- training
          |   |   |-- image_02
          |   |   |   |-- 0000
          |   |   |   |-- ...
          |-- |-- testing
          |-- label_02
          |   |-- 0000.txt
          |   |-- ...
          |-- data_tracking_calib
          |-- label_02_val_half
          |   |-- 0000.txt
          |   |-- ...
          |-- label_02_train_half
          |   |-- 0000.txt
          |   |-- ...
          `-- annotations
              |-- tracking_train.json
              |-- tracking_test.json
              |-- tracking_train_half.json
              `-- tracking_val_half.json
  ~~~

To convert the annotation in a suitable format for evaluating track AP, run this command in `tools`: `python convert_kitti_to_tao.py` 

### MOT 2017

MOT is also used to train and evaluate the system. Again, we will only use the training set (and create a validation set from it) for developing this project.

We have reused the dataset preprocessing script from CenterTrack.

~~~
    cd $PermaTrack_ROOT/tools/
    bash get_mot_17.sh
~~~

The script includes:

- Download and unzip the dataset from [MOT17 website](https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT17/).
- Convert it into COCO format using `tools/convert_mot_to_coco.py`.
- Create the half-half train/ val set.
- Interpolate the training annotations over occlusions, as described in the paper.
- Convert the public detection into a specific format.
- The output data structure should be:

  ~~~
  ${PermaTrack_ROOT}
  |-- data
  `-- |-- mot17
      `-- |--- train
          |   |--- MOT17-02-FRCNN
          |   |    |--- img1
          |   |    |--- gt
          |   |    |   |--- gt.txt
          |   |    |   |--- gt_train_half.txt
          |   |    |   |--- gt_val_half.txt
          |   |    |--- det
          |   |    |   |--- det.txt
          |   |    |   |--- det_train_half.txt
          |   |    |   |--- det_val_half.txt
          |   |--- ...
          |--- test
          |   |--- MOT17-01-FRCNN
          |---|--- ...
          `---| annotations
              |--- train_half.json
              |--- train_half_interp.json
              |--- val_half.json
              |--- train.json
              |--- train_interp.json
              `--- test.json
  ~~~


### nuScenes

nuScenes is used for training and evaluating 3D object tracking. We also used nuScenes for pretraining KITTI models.


- Download the dataset from [nuScenes website](https://www.nuscenes.org/download). You only need to download the "Keyframe blobs", and only need the images data. You also need to download the maps and all metadata to make the nuScenes API happy.


- Unzip, rename, and place (or symlink) the data as below. You will need to merge folders from different zip files.

  ~~~
  ${PermaTrack_ROOT}
  |-- data
  `-- |-- nuscenes
      `-- |-- v1.0-trainval
          |   |-- samples
          |   |   |-- CAM_BACK
          |   |   |   | -- xxx.jpg
          |   |   |-- CAM_BACK_LEFT
          |   |   |-- CAM_BACK_RIGHT
          |   |   |-- CAM_FRONT
          |   |   |-- CAM_FRONT_LEFT
          |   |   |-- CAM_FRONT_RIGHT
          |-- |-- maps
          `-- |-- v1.0-trainval_meta
  ~~~

- Run `python convert_kitti_to_coco.py` in `tools` to convert the annotation into COCO format. It will create `train.json`, `val.json`, `test.json` under `data/nuscenes/annotations`. nuScenes API is required for running the data preprocessing.

### CrowdHuman

CrowdHuman is used for pretraining the MOT model. Only the training set is used.

- Download the dataset from [its website](https://www.crowdhuman.org/download.html).

- Unzip and place (or symlink) the data as below. You will need to merge folders from different zip files.

  ~~~
  ${PermaTrack_ROOT}
  |-- data
  `-- |-- crowdhuman
      |-- |-- CrowdHuman_train
      |   |   |-- Images
      |-- |-- CrowdHuman_val
      |   |   |-- Images
      |-- |-- annotation_train.odgt
      |-- |-- annotation_val.odgt
  ~~~

- Run `python convert_crowdhuman_to_coco.py` in `tools` to convert the annotation into COCO format. It will create `train.json`, `val.json` under `data/crowdhuman/annotations`.
